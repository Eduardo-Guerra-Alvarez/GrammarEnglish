# Grammar English

This application was bulting with React Native, Expo and Firebase
This is an application about Verbs in English for personal use
Where you can search a verb in present, past and past participe
also you can press the verb and you can see an image referring to the verb

Now, you can add new verbs, but this option is to facilitate adding verbs to data base.
One time I have all the verbs, I'm going to remove this option.

## Intalation

You need [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [EXPO](https://expo.dev)

```
# Install packages
npm i
# Install the command line tools
    npm install --global expo-cli
```

Once the project is finshed I'm gonna upload the apk for Android and maybe after for IOS
